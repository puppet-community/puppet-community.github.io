# voxpupuli.github.io [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/voxpupuli/voxpupuli.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/voxpupuli/voxpupuli.github.io)

The https://voxpupuli.org site. Have a look at it to see what this is all about.

## Building this site

* `bundle install`
* `bundle exec jekyll serve -w --config _config.yml,_config-dev.yml`

You can also use the rake tasks defined in the `Rakefile`:

* `build`: `jekyll build`
* `validate`: uses html-proofer to check the generated site
* `clean`: removes the `./_site` directory Jekyll generated

## Puppet Plugins
Tools and plugins that appear on the Plugins page of our site
are defined in the `_data/tools` directory. Tools without plugins are going to
be listed in the table under the `Tools` header. Tools with plugins will have
their own header and table listing the plugins defined for that tool.

### Tool definition format
There's a single hash in each tool's definition that describes the tool and
optionally contains an array of plugins that can be used with that tool. A tool
that doesn't have any plugins will be listed in the table under the Tools header
while a tool that does have plugins will have its own header and a table listing
all plugins in the tool's `plugins` array.

#### Tool Schema:
| Key            | Value Data Type | Required or Optional |
| -------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| `name`         | String          | Required             |
| `display_name` | String          | Required             |
| `url`          | String          | Required             |
| `description`  | String          | Required             |
| `plugins`      | Array           | Optional             |

#### Plugin Schema:
| Key            | Value Data Type | Required or Optional |
| -------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| `name`         | String          | Required             |
| `url`          | String          | Required             |
| `description`  | String          | Required             |

### What's a tool vs. a plugin?
The difference can be kind of fluid, so I figured it would be helpful to define
plugin and tool.

A *plugin* cannot generally be used independent of another tool. Plugins add
functionality to another tool. An example of a plugin is `beaker-libvirt`
because it enables libvirt as a hypervisor in Beaker.

A *tool* can generally be used independent of another specific tool or it is a
tool that has plugins itself. An example of a tool is `rspec-puppet` because it
has plugins. Another example of a tool is `modulesync` because it can be used
independent of another tool.
